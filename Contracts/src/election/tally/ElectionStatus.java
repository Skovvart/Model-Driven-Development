 * Abstract State Machine for Election Algorithm.

 * state values and transitions between those states. The normal path for the 
 * outer tier of the state machine is: 
 * <p>
 * EMPTY --> SETTING_UP --> PRELOAD --> LOADING --> PRECOUNT --> 
 * COUNTING --> FINISHED
 * <p>
 * The inner state machine models the status of the count.
