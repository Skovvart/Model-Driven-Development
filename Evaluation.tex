\chapter{Evaluation}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Subjects} objects, or persons, being studied, whose properties or behavior is analyzed through the experiment. In the example subjects are programmers. 
\item \textbf{Factor} is the property, a variable, whose correlation we study. For example speed of programming in C vs speed of programing in C\#
\item \textbf{Treatment} one possible value of a factor, so in the example C and C\# are treatments.
\item \textbf{Outcome} result; numbers, other data, or qualitative information, indicating a correlation between treatments and observed variables. Example: correlation (or no) of speed of programming and the language.
