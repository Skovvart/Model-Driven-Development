\subsection{Behavior Driven Development}
\label{sub:bdd}
Behavior Driven Development is a fairly recent software development process. It is based on Test Driven Developement (TDD) and developed by Dan North in 2006 as a response to his own annoyance over identical misunderstandings occuring repeatedly when using TDD because of not knowing the behavior of the software as wished by stakeholders until late in the development process \cite{north2006}. 

The main component of BDD is called a feature. 
A feature is a part of a software system,
which can be specified by a range of specific behaviors called scenarios.
Such scenarios can be either specific consisting solely of a range of
assumptions and assertions, or be outlined in a way that allows
specification of a range of different example inputs.
Moreover feature descriptions allow specification of a background clause,
as a way to set the general context for the specific scenarios.
If the reader is further interested in basic feature definitions,
please refer to “The Cucumber Book” \cite{hellesoy2012}.
