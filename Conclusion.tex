\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
In this project we have created a complete framework for transforming informal behaviors, written in natural English, to formal code contracts.
We did this by extending an already popular BDD-based solution with small yet powerful extensions, and creating a new transformation language which
allows for easy and reusable mappings between natural language and code contracts.
We evaluated our framework named Salad by analyzing a subset of a real-world software project, the V\'{o}t\'{a}il electronic voting system, and were able to successfully generate
84.7\% equivalent JML contracts.

In future development we can attempt to increase our success rate for generation of contracts by further extending the framework with concepts like invariants.
To support more specialized concepts used by specific contracting frameworks such as JML,
we can explore ways to extend the generalized contracted software model, possibly by using variability-based modeling \cite{czarnecki2012cool}.
Another research possibility would be to strengthen the flexibility of the transformation language, to allow even more expressive and reusable
mappings.
