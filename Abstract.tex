\begin{abstract}
In this paper we create an extension for the behavior driven software development approach to allow for specification of code contracts.
This is meant to open up for the possibility of using a more agile development style for safety critical systems, where more systematic and formal specification of systems is necessary. 
The extension is architected by extending the feature definition language with behavior specifications that describe code contracts in human readable text.
These behaviors are then matched and translated to contracts using project-specific transformations specified in another new domain specific language aimed at defining contract matches. 
In that sense, the extension with contracts is implemented in a style compatible with the general spirit of behavior driven development. 

In this paper we propose to evaluate the framework on a case study from the electronic voting domain. 
The evaluation aims to show that the rule definition language allows defining sufficiently expressive rules as to express the contracts from the sample application.
