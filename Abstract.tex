Feature modeling is an important element of development of Software Product Lines. Much research exists on feature modeling languages, and
feature modeling tools. It is surprising though, that no experience reports exist of using feature modeling in industrial practice, and no characteristics of
industrial models is openly available. In this work we identify, present, and analyze two real life feature models of operating system kernels, eCos and Linux. We find that many assumptions about feature models made by tool builders in academia do not hold in reality, and thus many tools are potentially not useful; real models are substantially larger, and with higher density of constraints than previously anticipated.
